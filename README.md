# Lift Simulation Project

## Overview

The Lift Simulation project is a web-based application that visualizes the movement of lifts (elevators) in a multi-floor building. Users can input the number of floors and lifts, and interact with an interface that allows them to request lifts to specific floors. The project demonstrates both functional and interactive aspects of lift systems, including animations and mobile-friendly design.

## Features

- **User Input Page**: Allows users to specify the number of floors and lifts.
- **Interactive UI**: Visual depiction of lifts and floor buttons.
- **Lift Movement**: Lifts move to the requested floors when buttons are clicked.
- **Animation**: Lift doors open and close with a 2.5-second delay each; lifts move at a rate of 2 seconds per floor.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Responsive layout suitable for mobile devices.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1

1. **Data Store**: Contains the state of the application data.
2. **JS Engine**: Controls which lift goes where based on user interactions.
3. **Dumb UI**: A static UI that responds to commands from the controller.

### Milestone 2

1. **Lift Door Animation**: Doors open in 2.5 seconds and close in another 2.5 seconds.
2. **Lift Movement Animation**: Lifts move at 2 seconds per floor.
3. **Lift Stops**: Lifts stop at every floor where they were requested.
4. **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Ensures a responsive and user-friendly interface on mobile devices.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vyom1225/Lift-simulation.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd lift-simulation
    ```
3. **Open `index.html`**: You can open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view and interact with the simulation.

## Usage

1. Enter the number of floors and lifts on the input page.
2. Click the buttons on the floors to request a lift.
3. Observe the lift animations and interactions as they move to the requested floors.

## Development

- **HTML/CSS**: Structure and style the page and interactive elements.
- **JavaScript**: Implement the logic for lift movement, state management, and animations.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application works well on various screen sizes.
